# survey-form-creation-pure-javascript

The goal of this challenge is to build a interface to record user survey [pure/plain JavaScript].

1. The user opens the page & should be presented with multiple questions & appropriate input fields to record the answers
2. Questions marked as "required" cannot be left blank before submitting the survey.
3. Once the user submits a valid form, hide the form & show a success alert that the form is now successfully submitted.

The project skeleton contains a lightweight server written in Nodejs for serving the required endpoints to load the survey related information.

You may:

- Include Twitter Bootstrap or any other CSS frameworks for styling purposes (only CSS & not JS)
- Use Es6 or Typescript or Coffescript
- Be as creative as possible with the UI/UX design but that's not the primary goal.

You should not:

- Use any frameworks or JS libraries(e.g; AngularJS, jQuery, etc)
- modify the server
